# Road Map

The road map, initially, is just a part of the configuration for chiji project.

But it is really powerful and support a little much of options around the resource itself, so here is a special topic on it.

NOTICE: This topic is mostly for the people working with particular tools such as templating engines, preprocessors. In addition, if you are Symfony developer, this topic is also not necessary for you because you could have a terrific config file in chiji-bundle for symfony.
