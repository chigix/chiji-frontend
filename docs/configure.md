# Project Configuration

In Chiji Frontend solution project, it use PHP script as the config file directly instead of aweful text file with limitted format.

Globally, The Chiji frontend framework provide a super configuration class, which could be extended to add your configuration logic or do some special override.

Maybe the use case in chiji-bundle, the symfony bridge bundle for chiji frontend solution project, could be the best demo to learn.
